a collection of haiku<br>
about life, the universe and everything<br>
by Hans Lachman, 2022<br>
<br>
<b>Dinner with Friends</b><br>
<br>
This will save the world:<br>
In-person dinner with friends,<br>
Sometimes friends of friends.<br>
<br>
<b>My Bio 2022</b><br>
<br>
A colorful past.<br>
A creative neurotic.<br>
Now, just a recluse.<br>
<br>
<b>My Philosophy of Philosophy</b><br>
<br>
Each philosophy,<br>
Needed by some but not all,<br>
Like a prescription.<br>
<br>
<b>My Religion</b><br>
<br>
G.O.D. stands for:<br>
Gratitude, Optimism,<br>
Decency. That's all.<br>
<br>
<b>Comparative Religion</b><br>
<br>
Many religions.<br>
If it gets you there, it's right.<br>
Like a vehicle.<br>
<br>
<b>My Planet</b><br>
<br>
Earth has a purpose.<br>
It's the insane asylum<br>
Of the universe.<br>
<br>
<b>Happiness and Unhappiness</b><br>
<br>
Happy, unhappy.<br>
Both of them, useful signals.<br>
Lights on a dashboard.<br>
<br>
<b>A How-to Guide</b><br>
<br>
To be happy, ask:<br>
What are your needs and your dreams?<br>
Move forward on that.<br>
<br>
<b>Improvement to Maslow</b><br>
<br>
Hierarchy of needs:<br>
Resources, relations, and<br>
Relevance. Three R's!<br>
<br>
<b>More R's</b><br>
<br>
Recreation, and<br>
Rest and relaxation too.<br>
Maslow forgot these.<br>
<br>
<b>A Nod to Osho-Rajneesh</b><br>
<br>
Zorba the Buddha.<br>
Inner journey, outer life.<br>
Two wings of a bird.<br>
<br>
<b>What is Tantra</b><br>
<br>
Inside and outside:<br>
Awareness, acceptance, and<br>
Appreciation.<br>
<br>
<b>The Divine Play</b><br>
<br>
In the play of life,<br>
God is a method actor.<br>
Do you think you're you?<br>
<br>
<b>What to Do with People</b><br>
<br>
Life has transactions.<br>
Balance with co-creation<br>
And companionship.<br>
